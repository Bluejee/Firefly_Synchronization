# Firefly Synchronization Simulation

This project presents a mesmerizing simulation of firefly synchronization, demonstrating the emergent behavior of bioluminescence in a swarm of fireflies. Inspired by the natural phenomenon of synchronized blinking, this simulation employs mathematical rules to achieve synchronization among individual fireflies, resulting in a captivating display of blinking in unison.

The simulation is developed using the Java-based [Processing v4.0b1](https://processing.org/) programming language, known for its capabilities in visual arts and design.

## Getting Started

That's a great addition! Incorporating this enhanced "Prerequisites" section will provide users with clearer guidance on setting up their environment for running the simulation. Here's how it could be integrated into the README:

### Prerequisites

To successfully run this simulation, ensure you have the following setup on your computer:

1. **Processing Installation**: Download and install Processing v4.0b1 from the [official Processing website](https://processing.org/download/). This is the primary platform on which the simulation runs.
   
2. **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: Since Processing is Java-based, ensure you have Java Runtime Environment installed. This is typically pre-installed on many systems, but it's good to verify or update it.

3. **Learning Resources**: For those new to Processing or seeking to enhance their skills, the [Coding Train YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) offers excellent tutorials and resources for learning and mastering programming in Processing.

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the firefly synchronization simulation:

1. Clone this repository or download the 'fireflies' folder.
2. Navigate to the `projects` directory within your Processing installation.
3. Place the 'fireflies' folder inside the `projects` directory.

### Running the Simulation

To execute the simulation:

1. Open the Processing editor.
2. Navigate to `File > Open` and select the `Fireflies.pde` file from the 'fireflies' folder.(Note that one is the main program and `Firefly.pde` is the class)
3. Press the 'Play' button or use the shortcut `CTRL + R` (Windows) / `CMD + R` (Mac) to run the simulation.

### Customization

Experiment with the simulation by adjusting its parameters:

- Modify parameters such as the number of fireflies, blinking frequency, and others in the `Fireflies.pde` file.
- Observe how changes in these parameters affect the synchronization behavior.
